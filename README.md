# BookSwap

Welcome to BookSwap, the first project aimed at supporting book lending.

The project aim is to support communities to lend and borrow books between each other, saving themselves money and also allowing people less fortunate to enjoy reading.

The project is runned by Zelig880 (www.zelig880.com), and is open to everyone that wants to contribute.
